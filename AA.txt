refresh of AA


work spaces:

Its like ad hoc analysis, drag drop metrics, dimensions, quick graphs, more like interactive dashboard.

viewport tracking within DTM - to track the visible areas in the website

DTM version control

If metrics are dependent on the page load, then better capture the information required on current page load and then grab it on next page.
Isolation code - the code which grabs the info on the page load, this code is independent of the adobe base code as we dont want to delay AA tracking call. This isolation code just be independent where we don't interfere in AA base code.
So, on the next page when AA code loads, it can check for the cookie placed in the previous page (the cookie is placed by isolated code) and the plug in to AA variable. However, on the first page, where there is no cookie, then AA will check if cookie is present or not. If not then no need to pass the info to AA variables.
